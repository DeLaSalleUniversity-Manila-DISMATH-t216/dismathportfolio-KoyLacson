#### Victor Anthony C. Lacson DISMATH EL

### WEEK 1
* Discrete Mathematics was introduced

* I learned about propositions

* I learned how to create a truth table and determine truth values of a given logical variable

* I learned the formula used to calculate the number of rows in a truth table given a number of logical variables.

* Learned the basic logical symbols we will be using throughout the course

|Logical Symbol|Logical Operator|Meaning|
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|
|¬             |Negation        |not    |
|∧             |Conjunction     |and    |
|∨             |Disjunction     |or     |
|⊕            |Exclusive Disjunction|xor|
|→              |Conditional    |if, then|
|↔              |Biconditional  |iff|


### WEEK 2
* Learned about Logical Equivalences
* Learned about Quantifiers
  * Universal Quantifier (∀x) - for every possible x
  * Existential Quantifier (∃x) - there exists x such that P(x)
* It only takes one false statement to disprove a universal quantifier
* Likewise, if every outcome in an existential quantifier is proved to be true, then it may be considered a universal quantifier
* I learned about the Rules of Inference and how to use them to prove a proposition
* Was able to prove Superman does not exist through processes involving logical equivalences and the rules of inference
  
### WEEK 3
* Methods of proofs were introduced
  * Direct Proof (p → q)
    * Assuming p ≡ T, show that q ≡ T
  * Proof by Contraposition (¬q → ¬p)
    * Assuming ¬q ≡ T, show ¬p ≡ T.
  * Vacuous Proof (¬p → (p → q) )
  * Trivial Proof (q → (p → q) )
 
### WEEK 4
* Proof by Contradiction
  * Assuming ¬p, the whole statement is true, show that it leads to a contradiction
* Proof by Equivalence (p ↔ q)
  * Show (p → q) and (q → p) ≡ T.
* Mathematical Induction
  * 1. Basis (P(1) is true)
  * 2. Inductive Step
    * if P(k) ≡ T, then P(k+1) ≡ T for all positive integers, k.
* Recursion
  * 1. Basis 
  * 2. Recursive step
* Summation

### WEEK 5
* Biconditional Statement (p ↔ q)
* Induction and Recursion
* Program Correctness
* Hoare Triple

### WEEK 6
* Sets
  * Subsets/Supersets
  * Common Kinds of Sets
* Program Verification

### WEEK 7
* Functions
  * One-to-one Function (Injective)
  * Onto Function (Surjective)
  * Bijective
* Range and Codomain

### WEEK 8
* Algorithms
* Preconditions, Input, Postconditions, Output
* Pseudocodes
* Maximum Algorithm
* Linear Search Algorithm 

### WEEK 9
* Bubble Sort Algorithm
* Binary Search Algorithm
* Greedy Algorithm
* Big O Notation (upper bound function)
* Big Ω Notation (lower bound function)
* Big Θ Notation (both upper and lower bound functions)
* Time Complexity

### WEEK 10
* Graph Theory
  * vertices = nodes
  * edges = connection between nodes.
* The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected.
* A loop is counted twice when counting degrees of vertices.
* Handshake Theorem : 2e = Σ(degrees) * vertex ; where e is the number of edges
* Subgraph
* Euler's Circuit: covers all edges and returning to the same node where it started.
  * Graph contains Euler's Circuit if al nodes have even degrees
* Euler's Path : covers all edges although does not necessarily need to return to the starting node.
  * Graph contains Euler's Path if exactly 2 nodes have odd degrees.
* Hamilton's Circuit = all nodes covered and returns to starting node
* Hamilton's Path = all nodes covered.
* E(dge)uler ; HamiltoNodes
* A pendant node is a node with only one degree
* Adjacency and Incidency Matrices
* Isomporphs
* Graphs with no intersecting edges are called planar graphs
* Euler's Formula to find the regions of a graph : Region = Edges - Vertices + 2
* Kuratowski's Theorem

### WEEK 11
* Elementary Subdivisions
* Homeomorphic graphs are subgraphs which are obtained through series of elementary subdivisions
* Graph Coloring
  *Recycle colors when nodes are not adjacent(connected).
* Chromatic number = least number of colors to be used in a graph
* Planar graphs always have a chromatic number of 4.
* Trees
  * Parent - Child
  * Roots - Leaves
* M-ary trees contain m number of children to each parent.
* Language & Grammar
* Formal Language are used in computers because in other human languages, there are a lot of words with multiple meanings
* Automata Theory
* Finite Automaton
* Lexical Analysis
* Finite-state Machines
