### WEEK 1
* Discrete Mathematics was introduced

* I learned about propositions

* I learned how to create a truth table and determine truth values of a given logical variable

* I learned the formula used to calculate the number of rows in a truth table given a number of logical variables.

* Learned the basic logical symbols we will be using throughout the course

|Logical Symbol|Logical Operator|Meaning|
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|
|¬             |Negation        |not    |
|∧             |Conjunction     |and    |
|∨             |Disjunction     |or     |
|⊕            |Exclusive Disjunction|xor|
|→              |Conditional    |if, then|
|↔              |Biconditional  |iff|


### WEEK 2
* Learned about Logical Equivalences
* Learned about Quantifiers
  * Universal Quantifier (∀x) - for every possible x
  * Existential Quantifier (∃x) - there exists x such that P(x)
* It only takes one false statement to disprove a universal quantifier
* Likewise, if every outcome in an existential quantifier is proved to be true, then it may be considered a universal quantifier
* I learned about the Rules of Inference and how to use them to prove a proposition
* Was able to prove Superman does not exist through processes involving logical equivalences and the rules of inference
  
### WEEK 3
* Methods of proofs were introduced
  * Direct Proof (p → q)
    * Assuming p ≡ T, show that q ≡ T
  * Proof by Contraposition (¬q → ¬p)
    * Assuming ¬q ≡ T, show ¬p ≡ T.
  * Vacuous Proof (¬p → (p → q) )
  * Trivial Proof (q → (p → q) )
 
### WEEK 4
* Proof by Contradiction
  * Assuming ¬p, the whole statement is true, show that it leads to a contradiction
* Proof by Equivalence (p ↔ q)
  * Show (p → q) and (q → p) ≡ T.
* Mathematical Induction
  * 1. Basis (P(1) is true)
  * 2. Inductive Step
    * if P(k) ≡ T, then P(k+1) ≡ T for all positive integers, k.
* Recursion
  * 1. Basis 
  * 2. Recursive step
* Summation
